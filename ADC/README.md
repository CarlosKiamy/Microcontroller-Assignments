# ADC assignment
The assignment involves the following tasks:

- Task 1:

o Perform the measurement of an analog variable with a potentiometer and print its value on 10 LEDs.

- Task 2:

o Use the potentiometer characterization experiment to visualize by means of LEDs the phenomena of linearity, dead zone, saturation and bias. Explain in detail your observations even if the sensor used does not have any of these characteristics.

- Task 3

o Represent in a table the values of position, voltage, binary word. As an example, your table should look as follows

- Task 4

o Using the interpolation formulas seen in class, demonstrate analytically the values found in the table of task 3.
