# Microcontroller-Assignments
Repository with code evidence regarding the microcontroller university course. Every folder represents an assignment where certain tasks had to be solved using the STM32F303RE/STM32f411RE Nucleo-board microcontroller, where the whole projects are located. You can easily find the main code used under the MAINCODEHERE.c file for quick checking.
